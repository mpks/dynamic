Dynamic Documentation
=====================

Dynamic is a project about electron diffraction. It is developed by
Marko Petrovic (CCP4) with BBSRC grant funding. This website documents the 
research progress (code, scripts, results, theory, literature, etc)
and was inspired by a previous `CCP4 project <ccp4-ed_>`_ on 
electron diffraction.

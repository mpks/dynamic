 Results
............

 - David W. provided a fixed processing script for IRELOH. 
 - To confirm that our processing pipeline is correct, we compare Fc vs Fo
   plots generated from the original data (using DIALS) with the original Fc
   vs Fo graph (processed with XDS). Figures 1 and 2 show these plots. In
   general, we do not get exactly the same spots, but the number of spots and
   the hyperbolic fit match with the original. The comparison of original
   results vs our processing pipeline in Fig. 3 confirms that (within the
   level of noise) our pipeline matches that of the XDS.
 - Note on merging. The data in Figs 1-3 were obtained by processing with
   DIALS + shelxt and then exporting the fcf files. We only get the match if
   we either process with shelx (which does the merging) and then export the
   hkl to fcf files, or we merge and then export to hkl. If we only scale the
   data, but not merge it, and if we export it to hkl (without running
   shelxt), we will get a lot of spots for the same Miller index, and they
   won’t match the linear (hyperbolic) fit of the graphs in Figs 1 and 2.

   * - Fig. 1: Comparison between IRELOH data processed with our DIALS
       pipeline vs. the original data (from the paper). 
     - Fig. 2: Same as Fig. 1, but zoomed. 
     - Fig. 3: Comparing intensities and Fc for our pipeline (DIALS) versus
       the original (XDS). 

- Figure 4 suggests that the fit quality for the correction factor 
  :math:`|\rm F_{\rm e}|` may be highly dependent on the resolution 
  binning parameter.

   * - Fig. 4: Checking how resolution binning size determines the fit 
       params for the structure factor correction :math:`\rm |F_{\rm e}|`. 
       The :math:`\rm |F_{\rm e}|` was computed using the original data
       (from supplementary information).

- Implemented the excitation error in the Dynamic package. The excitation
  error still needs to be implemented in the GBT model (as a spot parameter).

  Discussion
............

- Test how binning affects the :math:`|\rm F_{\rm e}|` fit and, thus, the 
  quality of the structure solution. This will assess whether the bulk
  correction is robust. 
- Make plots that compare the spot excitation error vs deviation from the 
  kinematic approximation (the magnitude of dynamical diffraction correction). 
  Do this for the Paracetamol data on an image-by-image basis.

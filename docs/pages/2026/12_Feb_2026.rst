 Results
............

 - Wrote a function that goes through all datasets (image by image) and
   compares images by the number of matching Miller indices. This allowed us
   to identify images with very similar orientations (see Fig. 1). Next, we
   compared spot intensities between the matching images and other datasets
   (Fig. 2). In conclusion, the spread of spots for ED in paracetamol is 
   very large.

 - Repeated the whole procedure (matching Miller indices) for X-ray
   diffraction data for Ni DPPE material (Fig. 3). In general, the 
   spread of spots in intensity is much lower than that of electrons.

 - Discovered an error in previous results. The scaled.refl file keeps the
   integrated intensities in the prf and sum columns. The actual scaled values
   are stored elsewhere (and written only when exported to shelx hkl files).
   This processing error was causing a much larger spread in spot intensities
   across all datasets (as reported previously on 29/01/26 in Fig. 3 there).

       corresponding to two similar crystal orientations. Data for paracetamol
       (one degree rotation).
     - Fig. 2: The comparison of spot intensities for the spots found in the
       matching images in Fig. 1. The gray dots in the background show the
       spot intensities for the same Miller indices for other datasets (i. e.,
       other orientations). The spot intensities are read from the exported
       HKL files (shelx export in DIALS).
     - Fig. 3: Same as Fig. 2, but now for an X-ray dataset.

Same as Fig. 2, but now for an X-ray dataset.

- Once the error is corrected (i.e., the properly scaled intensities are
  read), the R1 in the GBT model drops significantly even before
  implementing any additional properties (Fig. 4).

       factors and the
       actual values across all one degree paracetamol datasets. The GBT
       model was trained on the first 100 datasets and it
       was tested on other 100 datasets (from 100 to 200). The blue spots
       show :math:`R_1` computed using only integrated intensities,
       whereas the red spots show the same 
       :math:`R_1`, but
       now in the model trained on scaled data (which is less noisy).

  Discussion
............

 - Look at the beam intensity (integrate the intensity on a circle around the
   beam position), or the average spot intensity, to understand why the spread
   in spot intensity occurs. How much of it comes from variations in beam
   intensity across datasets (for integrated, unscaled data)? 

 - If the spread is Gaussian, there might be a way to compute the likelihood
   that the two matching spots were selected at random, rather than being
   correlated. 

 - The images visually show the spread behaviour, but we still lack a way to
   precisely quantify spot spread across an entire dataset. Need to develop a
   way to quantify it.

 - Is the noise the same across all spots, or are there clusters of spots with
   low spread and others with high spread (does it depend on the spot
   intensity)? What is the effect of removing noisy spots? Does the spread
   decrease? 

 - Do simulations run with abTEM confirm the extent of the spread? In other
   words, how much of the spread can be attributed to noise in measurement,
   and how much to a dynamical (physical) effect.

 - Are any of the extreme spots in the spread maybe related to special
   orientations (unit cell axes aligned with the beam, or the beam aligned
   with some of the principal axes in the crystal)? 

 - Is the shelx solution better when we apply our model to integrated data and
   scale it with DIALS, or when we scale the data first and then train our
   model on the scaled data? At which point in the processing pipeline should
   our model be introduced, and is there any difference between applying it at
   different stages?

 - Since electron diffraction is better for solving structures in charged
   states, it would be interesting to perform first-principles simulations
   (Bloch-wave or Multislice) on systems where charge is introduced by hand,
   and compare the resulting diffraction data with that for the neutral case.

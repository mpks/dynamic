 - The problem we encountered last week was that most spots had a very large
   intensity range (after scaling all datasets). The question was, is there
   any parameter that correlates with the spread (for example, an excitation
   error)? The goal was to pick a single spot and check how its intensity
   across multiple datasets correlates with its environment or orientation.
   Figures 1, 2, and 3 show just that (a correlation with the excitation
   error), for three randomly selected spots. Data with :math:`I/\sigma < 2`
   are grayed out because they might not be very accurate. Spot intensities 
   are scaled between zero and one based on the 97% percentile intensity 
   (to avoid outlier bad spots with unrealistically high intensities).

 - Figure 4 shows the same plot as Figures. 1-3, but now aggregated for a 
   few spots. In general, we cannot say that there is a correlation between
   high-intensity spots and zero excitation error. We see that low-intensity
   spots are noisier, which is expected.

       (-4, -1, -9). Each point is extracted from a 
       different Paracetamol dataset. 
     - Fig. 2: Same as Fig. 1, but now for spot (-4, -3, -6).
     - Fig. 3: Same as Fig. 1, but now for spot (-3, 1, -9).

- Besides the excitation error, we tried many different quantities that 
  might describe the spot environment on a single image (number of nearest 
  neighbors in the reciprocal space, average weighted neighbor intensity, 
  total number of spots in the image, etc). However, none of them showed any
  strong correlation with the intensity. For example, in Figs. 5 and 6, we 
  show the results for the number of 3-beam neighbors. Here, for every image
  where a specific dot :math:`g = (H,\ K,\ L)` appears, we counted all the
  other spot pairs :math:`g’` and :math:`g’’` that satisfy the condition
  :math:`g’ + g’’ = g`. Again, there is no strong correlation with the 
  intensity.

  Discussion
............

 - All the previous graphs lack the value of :math:`I_{\rm cal}` for the
   solved structure, so it is impossible to say anything about the intensity
   distribution (which points are above :math:`I_{\rm cal}`, which are 
   below?).

 - It is not clear whether the spread in intensity is a consequence of a 
   physical effect, a noise in measurement, or a processing error. We can
   determine that by processing other datasets (X-ray and electron). If 
   the effect is physical, it can be determined using Bloch-wave or 
   multislice simulations. If the measured data is too noisy, the simulation
   results can be used for training. 

 - Find datasets with similar orientations (same spot appearing on similar 
   images), and compare the intensities. Might tell us how the environment 
   affects the spot (i.e., is the relative intensity the same or not). 
   One thing this might not account for is thickness. We could have the same
   orientation but different thicknesses, and therefore get different results.

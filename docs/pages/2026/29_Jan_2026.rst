 Results
............

 - Compared the spot excitation error with how much a spot is enhanced or
   suppressed (Figs. 1 and 2). In general, there is no one-to-one correlation
   between the excitation error and the dynamical effects. This is probably
   because the intensities are redistributed between several spots.
 - Another problem in determining which spots are enhanced and which are
   suppressed is setting an appropriate scale between Fo and Fc. Considering
   that the spread of spot intensities on an image-by-image basis is large
   (Fig. 3), it looks as though spots on individual images might behave
   differently than their mean (merged) intensities. For example, the spot
   whose merge intensity is suppressed (as compared to Fc) might be boosted on
   an individual image.

       (upper right). The lower panels show whether the spot is strong or a
       weak one (lower left) and how strong its signal is (lower right).

  Discussion
............

 - Do results get better if we eliminate noisy data (look at Rmerge and flag
   strong). Also, apply additional filtering to spots with high signal strength (I/sigma). 
 - Examine how the spread of a single spot (Miller indices) is affected by its
   environment. Try to quantify the environment (e.g., a list of Miller indices or a Patterson map). 
 - Run dials correlation matrix on the clustered Paracetamol datasets,
   to see if there are any subclusters.
